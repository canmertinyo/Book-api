# Quick brief

You can create/update/delete books and authors

# Installation

First we must install all dependencies. write this in terminal :

```ts
npm install
```

# Setting up database

.env configuration :

```env
DATABASE_URL="yourdatabaselink"
PORT=5000 (or you can put here a different port)
```

and open our prisma/schema.prisma file
define your database provider :
for example mine is mongodb. So i wrote here "mongodb"

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

# To Use

# Create new author (POST Method)
Open our postman application and send a post request to our server.
Example : http://localhost:5000/api/authors
Important Note : it supports only json format !
```json
{
        "firstName":"can",
        "lastName":"mert"
}
```
After that you will receive a new output like this : 
```json
{
    "id": "63e2d81210c0f8c2f6ff7c74",
    "firstName": "can",
    "lastName": "mert",
    "createdAt": "2023-02-07T23:00:34.277Z"
}
```
The api will give you a random id. Because if you wanna add new book on your own, you must give your id.

# Update author (PUT Method)

You must entry your id
